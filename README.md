The Goofiest Ahh Website


This is a website that me and my friend are working on (my friend unfortunately isn't really that persistent in this project, he's very good with HTML) this website is not perfect, but we are working hard to make it that way..

I will ask my older brother if I can use one of his old PCs for a server, which I can probably use for a proxy.

A LOT of games are going to be here soon, so be checking the site soon.

Oh, yeah. Here's some links for the Goofy Ahh Website:

I'll also be adding more links in the future, maybe even buying some, and using a better website hosting service.
